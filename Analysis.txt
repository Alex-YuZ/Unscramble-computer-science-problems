As this is to get the head and tail of a list, there is no need to iterate all over the whole object, that is to say no matter what size the input is, the run time would be at a constant rate, so the time complexity (Worst-Case ) in Big-O Notation is O(1).

algorithm:
1. transform a column of the whole data set into a list: O(n)
2. convert a list to a set: O(n)
3. union operation between sets: O(n)
4. get the length of a set: O(1)

So, the worst-case complexity is O(n)
